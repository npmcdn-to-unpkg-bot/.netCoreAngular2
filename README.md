#A proof of concept showing Angular2 app running in a .NET Core platform

Assuming that you have .NET Core already installed (https://dotnet.github.io/getting-started/) run the following commands:

Install dependencies
> dnu restore

Build the project:
> dnu build

Launch app
> dnx web

The application should be displayed in the browser in http://localhost:5000
